# MY TODO LIST

## Java

- global renaming (directory (package) rename, moving package, moving batch of java files)
- integrate `stevearc/overseer.nvim` instead `CRAG666/code_runner.nvim` (as starting facing flexibility limitations)

### Not in priority now

- gradle support (not priority, as I'm currently mostly on maven)
