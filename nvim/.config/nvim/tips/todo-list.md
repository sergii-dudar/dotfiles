# MY TODO LIST

## Java

- java traces combined qflist with project local and decompiled class locations from jdtls
- global renaming (directory (package) rename, moving package, moving batch of java files)
- fixing `vscode-spring-boot-tools` integration to jdtls

### No in priority now

- gradle support (not priority, as I'm currently mostly on maven)
